                 <p>With all the constant changes in knowledge, I look to 
                    see how far I can challenge myself with
                    experimentation to try to understand what makes up 
                    the Internet.
                </p><br>
            
                <p>Most things that I do involve trying to figure stuff out on my 
                    own; I love to study and aim to remain a life-long
                    learner. That is why I chose Northwestern University 
                    to teach me from the basics on how to make a
                    website and web applications.
                </p><br>
            
                <p>In my own personal time, I run my own photography 
                    business, where my interest lies in editing my
                    photos to tell the story that I want them to tell. I 
                    find fishing to be very interesting, and plan to
                    learn how to fish one day soon. I spend the most time with my 
                    computer, something I fell in love with a very long
                    time ago. (Will tell you the story one day.)
                </p><br>
            
                <p>I play video games that offer very high levels of customization, 
                    push players to find pieces to the puzzle, and that most of
                    all prioritize working as a collaborative team. I love to spend 
                    some family time and relax wth my lovely family.
                </p><br>
